<p><strong>An AAPI resources, North Carolina focused website that educates and uplifts the AAPI community after recent violence during the COVID-19 pandemic.</strong></p>

<p>"cùng nhau" is the Vietnamese word for "together." It is imperative to come together as a community to support AAPI individuals, especially women and
the elderly, who have disproportionally received a large amount of violence. </p>

<p>This project is created for DiamondHacks NCSU 2021 by Minh-Thu Dinh, Namrata Rajaraman, Cynthia Rios, and Chitra Srinivasan.</p>
