<p>An AAPI resources, North Carolina focused website that educates and uplifts the AAPI community after recent violence during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>"c√∫ng nhau" is the Vietnamese word for "together." It is necessary to come together as a community to support AAPI individuals, especially women and
the elderly, who have disproportionally received a large amount of violence. </p>
