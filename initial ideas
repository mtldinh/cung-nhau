there's a carrd going around: https://anti-asianviolenceresources.carrd.co/ that has a similar thing going on

good things with this site:
mental health - offering free counselors uwu
report an incident - at least they included this lol

problems with this site:
limited to mainstream news sources for anti-asian violence - this isn't really comprehensive and it removes a lot of the more rooted reasons why the rise in violence has occurred (sinophobia, xenophobia, general imperalism of america, previously restrictive laws, model minority myth, etc). the work begins wtih reading more than just NBC
difficult accessibility - small font, inaccessible colors, weird kerning
who needs corporate statements? - as nice as it is that these large corporations stand against racism, that doesn't really comfort me (personally) as an asian american
only donations, not mutual aid for AAPI - i do love AAAJ though, they're always very rad. red canary song is one (a bit controversial) and there are a lot more asian low-income focused collectives. where is the money going for these larger orgs?
too broad - should this be north carolina based? 
no strong focus on non-profits/orgs that are putting in the work
limited access to protests and information
petitions are kinda wack, is that something we want to include?
